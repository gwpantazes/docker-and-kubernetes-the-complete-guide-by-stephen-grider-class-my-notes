# My Notes on "Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide" by Stephen Grider on Udemy

Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/

This repository is my note-taking and learning process for the course.

I am publishing my notes as open-source mostly to incentivize myself to take good notes for my own sake, to keep up my pace in the course, and to open my learning process.

The goal isn't to make the course redundant with amazing notes, or to be a legitimate resource for internet wanderers. Although, if I end up helping someone along the way, so be it.
